My notes on [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) Ch. 7 on Model Assessment and Selection

## **7.1 Introduction**

  - ***generalization*** performance of a learning method: its prediction capability on independent test data
      - guides the choice of learning method or model
      - a measure of the quality of the ultimately chosen model
      
## **7.2 Bias, Variance, and Model Complexity**

  - Consider the case of a quantitative or interval scale response with:
      - target variable $Y$
      - vectors of inputs $X$
      - prediction model $\hat{f}(X)$ estimated from a training set $\tau$
      - a loss function for measuring errors between $Y$ and $\hat{f}(X)$: $L\left(Y, \hat{f}(X) \right)$
          - typical choices:
          
          $$
          L\left(Y, \hat{f}(X)\right) = \begin{cases}
                                        \left(Y-\hat{f}(X) \right)^2 & \text{squared error} \\
                                        \left\lvert Y-\hat{f}(X)\right\rvert & \text{absolute error}
                                        \end{cases}
          $$
      - ***test error***, aka ***generalization error***: the prediction error over an independent test sample
      $$
      \text{Err}_\tau = \text{E} \left[L \left(Y, \hat{f}(X) \right) \mid \tau \right]
      $$
          - $X$ and $Y$ drawn randomly from their joint distribution (population)
          - here the training set $\tau$ is fixed, and the test error is for this specific training set
      - ***expected prediction error***, aka ***expected test error***:
      $$
      \begin{align}
      \text{Err}  & = \text{E} \left[L \left(Y, \hat{f}(X) \right) \right] \\
                  & = \text{E} \left[\text{Err}_\tau \right]
      \end{align}
      $$
          - expectation averages over everything that is random, including randomness in the training set that produced $\hat{f}$
          - goal: estimate $\text{Err}_\tau$. However, $\text{Err}$ is more amenable to statistical analysis
      - ***training error***: the average loss over the training sample:
      $$
      \overline{\text{err}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^n L\left(y_i, \hat{f}(x_i) \right)
      $$
